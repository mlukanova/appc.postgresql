# Installation
The connector works in the context of Arrow application.

So first [create your Arrow application](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/guide/API_Builder_Getting_Started). 

In the terminal from the root of your app install the connector with:

```sh 
appc install connector/appc.postgresql
```

# Configuration
After the installation you will see `conf/appc.postgresql.default.js` config file.

It will contain template with all configuration parameters.

Some of them have default values but other must be configured appropriately.

For this connector you need to set the following configuration properties:
```sh
module.exports = {
  connectors: {
    'appc.postgresql': {
      connectionPooling: '<OPTIONAL. SET IF YOU WANT TO USE CONNECTION POOLING OR NOT.CAN BE FALSE OR TRUE>',
      connectionLimit: '<OPTIONAL. SET IF YOU WANT TO USE CONNECTION POOLING OR NOT. SET THE LIMIT AS A NUMBER>',


      database: '<MANDATORY. YOUR DATABASE NAME>',
      user: '<MANDATORY. YOUR DATABASE USER>',
      password: '<MANDATORY. YOUR DATABASE PASSWORD>',
      host: '<MANDATORY. YOUR DATABASE HOST.>',
      port: '<MANDATORY. YOUR DATABASE PORT.>',

      generateModels: '<OPTIONAL. ARRAY OF MODEL NAMES THAT NEED TO BE GENERATED>',
      modelAutogen: true,
      generateModelsFromSchema: true,
      skipModelNamespace: false,
      modelNamespace: '<OPTIONAL. OVERRIDES THE DEFAULT NAMESPACE VALUE WHICH IS SET TO THE NAME OF THE CONNECTOR.>'
    }
  }
}
```

# Usage
Run your arrow application with:
```sh 
appc run
```

Then open the admin ui pannel usually at http://localhost:8080/arrow to play with the available models and exposed endpoints.

## Auto generated keys and user defined ones

The connector handles data sources with auto generated ids and user defined ones. If your service has auto generated ids you'll see the Key of every entity as 'id'. Otherwise you'll also have a dublicate of the id. For example if your Key is 'UserName' the dublicate will be visible as 'UserNameID' and will have the same value as 'id'.  
You can create a new record by entering the value for the Key as the dublicate. For example if we enter data: 
```sh
{'UserNameID': 'johndoe',
  'Age' : 30
}
```
and we have Key for the table 'UserName' this will create a record with 'UserName' johndoe and 'Age' 30. 

## Where clause

The connector supports queries. You can use the following: '{"Name": {"$eq": "Tom"}}' to get the record with 'Name' equal to 'Tom'.
Full list of all supported operators :
 Operator | Meaning              
----------|----------------------
 $lt      | less than            
 $lte     | less than or equal   
 $gt      | greater than         
 $gte     | greater than or equal
 $ne      | not equal            
 $eq      | equal

## Sample Development Workflow

Clone this repository

From the root of your project run `npm install`

Run `npm test` to see unite test suite test results

Start doing your code changes

Make sure the test suite is still working after code changes

### Start the connector in standalone mode 
Run the following command to do this:
```sh
npm start
```

Usually you could open http://localhost:8080/arrow to play with the available models and endpoints.
